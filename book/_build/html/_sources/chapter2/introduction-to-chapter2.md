### Engaging Hands-on Activities for Teachers using GenAI

In this session, you'll participate in three progressively structured activities, designed to showcase how AI can support teaching, facilitate authentic assessments, and balance AI-assisted learning with fostering students' independent and critical thinking skills.

#### Summary of the Activities

**Activity 1: Exploring Active Learning and AI in Education**

You will reflect on how Generative AI can integrate with Active Learning and related educational concepts (such as Assignments, Assessments, or Prompt Engineering). In pairs, you'll generate questions that explore the potential of AI to enhance these teaching strategies.

**Activity 2: AI-Assisted Assignment Creation**

* **Activity 2A**: Introduces zero-shot prompting, where AI generates an assignment without prior examples or input.  
* **Activity 2B**: Explores hybrid prompting, where you interact with AI to refine and improve the assignment design.  
* **Activity 2C**: Experience AI-assisted assignments from a student’s perspective, reflecting on the AI-generated output.

**Activity 3: AI-Powered Quiz Creation**

You will design quizzes using AI tools, focusing on three different approaches:

* **Group 1**: Creates quizzes tailored to special needs and multilingual learners, ensuring inclusivity and accessibility.  
* **Group 2**: Develops quizzes that combine closed (multiple-choice, true/false) and open-ended questions, with built-in feedback.  
* **Group 3**: Generates questions from a text corpus, offering customizable difficulty levels and language choices for students.

These activities are designed to explore the integration of AI in higher education with a focus on practical applications that enhance teaching and learning. You will engage with key educational concepts—active learning, assessment, feedback, and AI-enhanced instructional design—while gaining insight into how generative AI can effectively support teaching practices.

#### Steps for Each Activity

1. **Use the Structured Prompt**: Each activity includes a prompt that will guide your interaction with ChatGPT to generate outputs like assignments or quizzes.  
2. **Submit Your Outputs**: After completing each activity, you’ll submit your results in the corresponding Google Docs via Padlet, under the designated column for that specific task.  
3. **Evaluate the Prompts**: Evaluate the prompt’s usefulness and applicability on a scale of 1 to 5\.  
4. **Comment and Provide Feedback**: Leave constructive comments on Padlet, engage with others' submissions, and share insights or suggestions.

By completing these activities, you will develop a deeper understanding of how AI can enhance instructional design while critically assessing AI's role in complementing traditional teaching practices.

#### Additional Instructions for Padlet

* Each group posts their questions under the corresponding column based on the title of their concept.  
* The post title should include the group's name.  
* The post itself should explain the reasoning behind the questions and any key insights.

#### Peer Feedback Section

After posting their questions, each group will:

* Provide feedback on another group’s questions by commenting directly under their post.  
* Use the star rating system (1 to 5 stars) to evaluate the relevance and quality of other groups’ questions.

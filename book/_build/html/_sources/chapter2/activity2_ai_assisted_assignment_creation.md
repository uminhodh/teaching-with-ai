##### Activity 2: AI-Assisted Assignment Creation

**Overview**:  
This set of activities moves from zero-shot prompting to hybrid prompting, offering teachers the chance to create, refine, and experience AI-generated assignments both from the perspective of the teacher and the student.

---

**Activity 2A: Zero-Shot Prompt for Assignment Creation**  
This activity introduces zero-shot prompting, where AI generates an assignment without any prior examples.

**Activity 2B: Hybrid Prompting for Assignment Creation**  
Participants interact with AI to refine assignments using hybrid prompting, allowing for customization.

**Activity 2C: Hybrid Prompting—AI-Assisted Assignments for Students**  
Participants take on the role of students to complete AI-generated assignments, reflecting on their experiences.

**Sub-Activity 2A: Zero-Shot Prompt for Assignment Creation**

**Duration: 09:00 – 09:30** (30 minutes)

**Objective**: This activity introduces teachers to zero-shot prompting, where AI generates an assignment without prior examples.

**Steps**:

* **Task: Using ChatGPT to Generate Assignments (10 minutes)**: You use zero-shot prompting to create AI-generated assignments.  
  Example Prompt: "**Create a learning assignment for my \[insert Topic and Level of Instruction here\] class, focusing on \[insert key concepts or challenges related to the topic\].**"  
  Example: "*Create a learning assignment for my Intermediate French class, focusing on verb conjugation in the past tense and improving conversational fluency.*"  
* **Post and Rating on Padlet (5 minutes)**:  
  Share the AI-generated assignment link in the Padlet column titled "Activity 2A: Assignment" and rate it using the star system (1 to 5).  
* **Reflection and Discussionon Padlet  (10 minutes)**:  
  In the comments section of your post, discuss the effectiveness of the assignment generated and how it can be adapted to meet specific needs.

Now that we’ve explored the basics of AI-assisted assignment creation in Activity 1, we will move on to **hybrid prompting** in Activity 2\. This method allows for more interaction with the AI, helping you refine and customise the assignments further to better meet specific learning objectives.

| In the activities 2B and 2C, you will work in pairs. Each pair will create two quizzes. The process is as follows: Work in pairs to create two quizzes: Quiz 1: One teacher designs the assignment; their partner acts as the student and answers it. Quiz 2: The roles reverse, with the second teacher designing the assignment and their partner answering it. After completing both quizzes: Review your partner’s assignment. Provide feedback on its design. Mutual exchange of ideas and insights: Each teacher gains perspectives from both creating assessments and experiencing them as a student. Share suggestions for improvement based on these insights. |

**Sub-Activity 2C: Hybrid Prompting—AI-Assisted Assignments for Students**  
**Duration: 10:30 – 10:50** (20 minutes)

**Objective**: Participants take on the role of students to complete AI-generated assignments, reflecting on their experiences.

**Steps**:

* **Roleplay as a Student (10 minutes)**: You complete AI-generated assignments from Activity 2B as students.  
* **Posting Results on Padlet (5 minutes)**:  
  Share the AI-generated assignment link in the Padlet column titled "Activity 2C: Assignment" and rate it using the star system (1 to 5).  
* **Discussion (5 minutes)**:  
  * **Reflecting on Student vs Teacher Perspectives (5 minutes):** Reflect on how the student experience of AI-assisted assignments aligns with the initial teacher perspective. What insights did this provide regarding student engagement with AI-generated tasks?  
  * **Evaluating AI's Feedback Ability:** What does this suggest about the AI’s ability to offer useful feedback?  
  * **Analyzing Trends in Star Ratings:** Pay attention to the overall trend in the number of stars assigned across the three assignments generated in this activity. How consistent were the ratings?

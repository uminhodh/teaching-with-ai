##### Activity 1: Exploring Active Learning and AI in Education

**Duration: 08:30 – 09:00 (30 minutes)**

**Objective**: This activity invites you to collaborate in pairs to generate questions that critically reflect on the integration of AI into an Active Learning context, focusing on how AI can enhance or reshape educational approaches.

**Instructions**:

* **Pair Assignment (5 minutes)**: You are grouped in pairs to reflect on the intersection of Active Learning (AL) with one other educational concept and the role of Generative AI. Record the pairs’ names [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qyCBoQEw2kbAF9nDhKclgqq2H_yrlzigvdVacaRcsPk/edit).

**Tasks**:

* Read the provided theoretical section in the workbook related to your concepts.  
* Each pair builds 1 to 3 questions using ChatGPT that explore the connection between AL and their assigned concept, with a focus on GenAI.

**Example Assigned Concept**:  
AL & AI-Enhanced Assignments:

* How can AI-generated prompts support active learning through personalized and adaptive assignments?  
* How can generative AI enhance students’ ability to self-assess their work in active learning assignments?  
* In what ways can AI-powered feedback tools deepen students' engagement in collaborative, active learning tasks?

**Post on Padlet**: 

* **Once the questions are formulated, each group posts them in the [Padlet](https://padlet.com/workshopia9/coluna-k77uvrntxin9dtm6)** column 2 titled "Activity 1: AL & GenAI." The post must be named “AL & CONCEPT NAME.” In the post, explain the reasoning behind the selection of your question(s) **(5 minutes)**.  
* **Rate the Post (7 minutes)**: Review the posts from at least three other groups and use the star system (1 to 5\) on Padlet to assess the relevance and quality of their questions, focusing on clarity, connection to AL, and integration of GenAI.  
* **Peer Feedback on Padlet (7 minutes)**: After reviewing, choose the question you find most relevant and provide a brief comment explaining why in the comments section under their post.  
* **Group Discussion (5 minutes)**: One member from each pair will present their conclusions orally: Why do you think the selected question is crucial for understanding the integration of AI in AL?

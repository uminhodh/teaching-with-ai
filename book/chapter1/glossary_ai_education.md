### Glossary of AI-powered education

To enhance understanding of key terms related to AI-powered learning, here’s a detailed glossary:

* **AI-Enhanced Learning**:  
  The use of AI to offer real-time, personalized feedback and adaptive learning experiences that enhance student engagement and comprehension. **AI tools** like simulations, quizzes, and interactive exercises allow students to experiment with ideas and receive immediate responses, fostering a deeper understanding and exploration.  
* **AI-Assisted Learning**:  
  AI helps students organize their work, structure their ideas, or receive preliminary feedback, allowing them to focus on more complex problem-solving. **AI tools** such as task managers, automatic feedback systems, and organizational aids streamline processes like data collection or project management.  
* **AI-Resistant Learning**:  
  This type of learning focuses on tasks that require creativity, critical thinking, and originality—skills that AI cannot replicate. **AI-Resistant Learning** promotes human-centered activities such as debates, reflective writing, or creative projects where students are active creators of knowledge.  
* **AI-Inclusive Learning**:  
  AI technologies ensure equitable learning by providing adaptive tools and personalized support for all students, particularly those with learning disabilities or special needs. **AI tools** such as text-to-speech, adaptive quizzes, and differentiated instruction help create an inclusive environment.  
* **Authentic Active Learning**:  
  Students engage in real-world tasks that mirror professional or societal challenges, applying theoretical knowledge to practical problems. **AI** can assist by offering simulations, real-time data analysis, and problem-solving support in realistic contexts, but the focus remains on students' personal engagement and critical thinking.  
* **Authentic Assessment**:  
  Evaluations that mirror real-world tasks, requiring students to apply knowledge in practical ways. **AI tools** can support authentic assessments by offering real-time feedback, assisting in data analysis, or providing automated grading for complex projects, but students must still demonstrate creativity and problem-solving skills.  
* **Authentic Assignment**:  
  Assignments that engage students in solving real-world problems, conducting research, or completing tasks that reflect professional challenges. **AI** can assist in gathering research data, providing preliminary feedback, and helping students refine their ideas, but the core task requires student input and originality.

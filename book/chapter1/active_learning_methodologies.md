### Active Learning Methodologies with AI integration

#### [Case Studies](https://www.scribbr.com/methodology/case-study/)

* **Definition**: Students analyze real-world or hypothetical situations to apply theoretical concepts and develop problem-solving skills.  
  * **AI Application**: AI provides real-time, updated case studies relevant to subjects (e.g., legal cases, business challenges).  
  * **Impact**: Encourages critical thinking with the most current data and realistic contexts.

#### [Challenge-Based Learning](https://www.challengebasedlearning.org/)

* **Definition**: Students tackle interdisciplinary, real-world challenges requiring innovative solutions.  
  * **AI Application**: AI offers up-to-date data and contextual information about global issues (e.g., climate change, sustainability).  
  * **Impact**: Focuses on creating innovative solutions while enhancing critical thinking and problem-solving.

  #### [Flipped Classroom](https://bokcenter.harvard.edu/flipped-classrooms#:~:text=A%20flipped%20classroom%20is%20structured,that%20involve%20higher%20order%20thinking.)

  * **Definition**: Students learn new content at home and engage in interactive activities in the classroom.  
  * **AI Application**: AI generates reading summaries or video tutorials, prepping students for deeper in-class discussions.  
  * **Impact**: Maximizes class time for hands-on activities and deep discussions.

  #### [Peer Instruction](https://lsa.umich.edu/technology-services/news-events/all-news/teaching-tip-of-the-week/peer-instruction-for-active-learning.html)

  * **Definition**: Students answer conceptual questions, discuss in groups, and reach consensus.  
  * **AI Application**: AI generates conceptual questions and provides instant feedback to enhance group discussions.  
  * **Impact**: Facilitates deeper understanding and more informed discussions.

  #### [Problem-Based Learning](https://teaching.cornell.edu/problem-based-learning#:~:text=Problem%2Dbased%20learning%20\(PBL\),the%20motivation%20and%20the%20learning.)

  * **Definition**: Students solve real-world problems, applying knowledge and developing skills.  
  * **AI Application**: AI assists in gathering research and summarizing complex information related to the problem.  
  * **Impact**: Allows students to focus on problem-solving and real-life applications.

  #### [Service Learning](https://www.suffolk.edu/student-life/student-involvement/community-public-service/service-learning/what-is-service-learning#:~:text=%22Service%2Dlearning%20is%20a%20pedagogy,in%20a%20structured%20learning%20environment.%22)

  * **Definition**: Combines academic instruction with community service to address real-world issues.  
  * **AI Application**: AI analyzes local data and helps design impactful service projects.  
  * **Impact**: Enhances data-driven project design for targeted, effective community service.

  #### [Team-Based Learning](https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/team-based-learning/#:~:text=What%20is%20it%3F,work%20together%20throughout%20the%20class.)

  * **Definition**: Collaborative learning where students work in teams to solve problems.  
  * **AI Application**: AI helps manage team tasks by organizing workflows and suggesting timelines.  
  * **Impact**: Improves collaboration and communication within teams.

  #### [Think-Pair-Share](https://www.kent.edu/ctl/think-pair-share#:~:text=Think%2DPair%2DShare%20\(TPS,sitting%20near%20them%20\(PAIR\).)

  * **Definition**: Students think individually, discuss in pairs, and then share with the group.  
  * **AI Application**: AI generates discussion prompts, such as ethical dilemmas, for students to analyze collaboratively.  
  * **Impact**: Stimulates deeper discussions and collaborative exploration of complex topics.

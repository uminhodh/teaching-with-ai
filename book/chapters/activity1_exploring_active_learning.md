### Activity 1: Exploring Active Learning and AI in Education 

**Duration**: 08:30 – 09:00 (30 minutes)  
**Objective**: Reflect on how **Generative AI** can integrate with **Active Learning** (AL) and related educational concepts like assignments, assessments, and prompt engineering. Collaborate in pairs to generate thought-provoking questions that explore AI’s potential to enhance teaching strategies.  
**Instructions**:

·  **Pair Assignment (5 minutes)**:  
You are grouped into pairs to explore how **Active Learning** intersects with one additional educational concept and how **Generative AI** enhances both. Record your pair’s names.

·  **Task**:

* Review the theoretical section related to your assigned concept.  
* Generate **1 to 3 questions** using ChatGPT that connect **Active Learning** with your concept, emphasizing AI’s role in enhancing these strategies.  
* **Example Concept**:  
  * **AL & AI-Enhanced Assignments**:  
    * How can AI-generated prompts support active learning through personalized and adaptive assignments?  
    * How can generative AI enhance students' ability to self-assess their work in active learning assignments?  
    * In what ways can AI-powered feedback tools deepen students' engagement in collaborative active learning tasks?

·  **Post on Padlet (5 minutes)**:

* Once your group has formulated your question(s), post them in **Column 2 on [Padlet](https://padlet.com/workshopia9/coluna-k77uvrntxin9dtm6)**, under the title "Activity 1: AL & GenAI."  
* **Naming the Post**: Name your post "AL & \[CONCEPT NAME\]" (e.g., "AL & AI-Enhanced Assignments").  
* **Explanation**: Briefly explain why you selected these questions and how they connect **Active Learning (AL)** and **Generative AI (GenAI)**.

·  **Rate and Provide Peer Feedback (15 minutes)**:

* Review posts from at least three other groups, using the **star rating system** (1 to 5 stars) to evaluate questions based on their **clarity**, **relevance to Active Learning**, and **integration of Generative AI**.  
* Leave constructive comments, highlighting particularly insightful questions or offering suggestions for improvement.

·  **Group Discussion (5 minutes)**:  
One member from each group will present their conclusion orally, addressing the question:

* Why is this question crucial for understanding the integration of AI into Active Learning?

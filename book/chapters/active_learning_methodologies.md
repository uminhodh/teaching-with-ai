# 1\. Introduction: Integrating Active Learning and Generative AI 

In today's educational landscape, **Active Learning**—which emphasizes student participation, collaboration, and critical thinking—can be significantly enhanced by **Generative AI**. While Active Learning focuses on engaging students actively through problem-solving, discussion, and reflection, Generative AI complements these strategies by providing **personalized, adaptive content** and **real-time feedback**. Together, they create a learning environment that is **dynamic, tailored, and continuous**.

What is Generative AI?

* Generative AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that can generate new content—whether it's text, images, or other forms of media—based on input data.  
* In education, **Generative AI** helps create **adaptive learning paths**, **personalized assignments**, and **dynamic assessments** that evolve according to student needs and performance.

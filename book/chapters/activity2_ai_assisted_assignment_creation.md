### Activity 2: AI-Assisted Assignment Creation 

**Overview**: This set of activities introduces you to AI-assisted assignment creation, moving from zero-shot prompting to hybrid prompting. Teachers will create, refine, and experience AI-generated assignments both from the teacher’s and the student’s perspectives.

#### Sub-Activity 2A: Zero-Shot Prompt for Assignment Creation 

**Duration**: 09:00 – 09:30 (30 minutes)  
**Objective**: Introduce zero-shot prompting, where AI generates an assignment without prior examples.  
**Steps**:

1. **Task (10 minutes)**:  
   Use zero-shot prompting in ChatGPT to generate assignments based on your class topic and instruction level.  
   * **Example Prompt**: "Create a learning assignment for my Intermediate French class, focusing on verb conjugation in the past tense and improving conversational fluency."  
2. **Post and Rate on Padlet (5 minutes)**:  
   * Share the AI-generated assignment link in the Padlet column titled "Activity 2A: Assignment."  
   * Use the star system (1 to 5\) to rate the clarity, relevance, and creativity of the assignment.  
3. **Reflection and Discussion (10 minutes)**:  
   * In the comments section of your post, reflect on how the AI-generated assignment aligns with student engagement and real-world learning. How would you adapt it to meet specific classroom needs?  
     



Now that we’ve explored the basics of AI-assisted assignment creation in Activity 1, we will move on to **hybrid prompting** in Activity 2\. This method allows for more interaction with the AI, helping you refine and customise the assignments further to better meet specific learning objectives.

In the activities 2B and 2C, you will work in pairs. Each pair will create two quizzes. The process is as follows:

**Work in pairs to create two quizzes:**

* **Quiz 1:** One teacher designs the assignment; their partner acts as the student and answers it.  
* **Quiz 2:** The roles reverse, with the second teacher designing the assignment and their partner answering it.  
  **After completing both quizzes:**  
* Review your partner’s assignment.  
* Provide feedback on its design.  
  **Mutual exchange of ideas and insights:**  
* Each teacher gains perspectives from both creating assessments and experiencing them as a student.  
* Share suggestions for improvement based on these insights.



#### Sub-Activity 2B: Structured Prompting for Assignment Creation 

**Duration**: 09:30 – 10:00 (30 minutes)  
**Objective**: Introduce structured prompting, where participants refine AI-generated assignments with additional input to improve specificity and relevance.  
**Steps**:

1. **Task (10 minutes)**:  
   Use structured prompting in ChatGPT to refine the AI-generated assignment. Add specific instructions to enhance clarity, collaboration, and real-world relevance.  
   * **Example**: After generating a base assignment, prompt ChatGPT to include collaborative activities, adjust the difficulty level, and ensure the task’s real-world applicability.  
2. **Post and Rate on Padlet (5 minutes)**:  
   * Share the assignment in the "Activity 2B: Assignment" column.  
   * Rate the structured assignment and discuss its effectiveness compared to zero-shot prompting.  
3. **Reflection and Discussion (10 minutes)**:  
   * Compare the control and flexibility of structured versus zero-shot prompting. Which method provided more value in terms of refining and adapting the assignment?




#### Sub-Activity 2C: Hybrid Prompting—AI-Assisted Assignments from a Student's Perspective 

**Duration**: 10:30 – 10:50 (20 minutes)  
**Objective**: Experience AI-assisted assignments from the student’s perspective and reflect on the engagement and challenge of AI-generated assignments.  
**Steps**:

1. **Complete the AI-Generated Assignment (10 minutes)**:  
   Act as a student and complete the AI-generated assignment created in Sub-Activity 2B.  
2. **Post on Padlet (5 minutes)**:  
   Share your completed assignment link and reflect on the student experience.  
3. **Discussion (5 minutes)**:  
   Reflect on the quality of AI's feedback and how well the assignment worked from a student perspective. Was the task engaging, clear, and appropriately challenging?

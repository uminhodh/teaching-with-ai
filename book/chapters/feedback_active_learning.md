### Feedback in Active Learning

**Feedback** plays a crucial role in helping students improve and reflect on their learning journey. By integrating AI, feedback can be timely, personalized, and more actionable.

#### **Types of feedback**

* **Self-Feedback**: Encourages reflection and self-assessment.  
* **Peer Feedback**: Engages students in reviewing each other’s work, fostering collaboration.  
* **Teacher Feedback**: Traditional feedback with support from AI tools for more detailed responses.  
* **AI-Based Feedback**: AI tools (e.g., **Grammarly**, **Socrative**) offer immediate, formative feedback, helping students adjust their work continuously.

#### **Feedback levels**

1. **Task and Product Level**: Focus on the quality of the student's output (e.g., "Your essay needs more analysis of X").  
2. **Process Level**: Offer strategies for improving the student's approach (e.g., "Try editing your argument flow").  
3. **Self-Regulation Level**: Encourage students to reflect on their learning process (e.g., "Consider your progress and set new goals").

#### AI-Based Feedback Using AI Tools

AI-based feedback, particularly through tools like ChatGPT and similar AI technologies, enhances the educational process by providing personalized, timely, and actionable insights. This framework outlines how these AI tools can be utilized for both formative and summative feedback, incorporating key AI concepts such as the feedback loop.

#### Activity 2C: Hybrid Prompting â€“ AI-Assisted Task Completion for Students

The prompt combines **conversational prompting** and **chain-of-thought prompting** to create an interactive, step-by-step dialogue. Conversational prompting engages the user, while chain-of-thought prompting organizes the workflow logically. The AI asks specific questions, provides structured guidance, and incorporates **iterative feedback and refinement**, ensuring continuous improvement throughout the process. This approach allows for dynamic interaction and a coherent progression through the assignment.

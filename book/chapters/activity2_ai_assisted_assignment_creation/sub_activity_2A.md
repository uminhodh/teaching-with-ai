#### Activity 2A: Authentic assignment creation

The prompt below uses **zero-shot prompting**. 
In this case, the AI is given a simple, open-ended instruction without any examples or prior context. The user provides the topic and level of instruction, and the AI is expected to generate a learning assignment based on those inputs. The AI has to infer the task structure and content from the minimal information given, without being guided by specific examples or previous outputs. 

This technique is efficient for generating creative outputs without providing detailed guidance or training the model with examples, relying on the AI's ability to generate relevant responses from a broad understanding of the task.

**PROMPT:** 
```
Create a learning assignment for assignment for my 
[insert Topic and Level of Instruction here] class, 
focusing on [insert key concepts or challenges related to the topic].
```
EXAMPLE: Create a learning assignment for my *Intermediate French* class, focusing on *verb conjugation in the past tense and improving conversational fluency*

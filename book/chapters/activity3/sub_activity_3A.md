#### Activity 3A: Creating a Quiz Tailored to Special Needs and Multilingual Options

The prompt below uses a combination of **conversational prompting**, **structured prompting**, and **adaptive prompting**. Here's how the prompting techniques are applied:

**Key techniques used:**

6. **Conversational Prompting**:  
   * The AI interacts with the user in a step-by-step conversation, asking questions and waiting for input before proceeding to the next step. This creates an ongoing dialogue that allows the user to guide the process interactively.  
7. **Structured Prompting**:  
   * The workflow is clearly broken down into steps (Step 1: Define the Topic, Step 2: Create Closed Questions, etc.), ensuring that each aspect of quiz creation is addressed systematically. The user is asked for input at each stage, and the AI follows a structured approach to guide the user through the process.  
8. **Adaptive Prompting**:  
   * The prompt is tailored to accommodate special needs and multilingual options, adapting the quiz to the specific requirements of the students. The AI offers to simplify questions, adjust the language, or adapt the quiz format based on student needs. This flexibility allows the AI to respond dynamically to the user’s input and make personalised adjustments.  
9. **Step-by-Step Guidance**:  
   * The prompt guides the user through each phase of the quiz creation process in a clear, sequential manner. Each step builds on the previous one, ensuring that the quiz is created comprehensively and thoughtfully.  
10. **User Validation**:  
    * The user is given the opportunity to review, validate, or modify the AI’s suggestions at each step, allowing for an iterative process where the user remains in control.

In summary, this prompt primarily uses **conversational prompting** to maintain an interactive dialogue, combined with **structured prompting** to ensure a step-by-step approach, and **adaptive prompting** to make adjustments based on special needs or multilingual requirements.

**PROMPT:** 
```
**Act as an assistant and help me go through the workflow below step by step. Ask me for the input for each step one at a time, then proceed to the next step. If you understand, answer with the first question of the first step** 

**Objective:** This prompt allows teachers to create a quiz tailored to their students’ specific needs, including special accommodations and multilingual versions.


**Ready to create a quiz specifically tailored to your students? I’ll guide you step by step through the process.**

Let’s start by defining the topic and key concepts for your quiz. You will create a quiz on \[insert topic here, e.g., ecosystems and biodiversity\] with a mix of closed (e.g., multiple-choice, true/false) and open-ended questions, each varying in complexity. At each step, you can review and validate ChatGPT’s suggestions or request additional questions. The quiz will be designed for either undergraduate or graduate students and can be adapted to accommodate any special needs, including a multilingual version if required.

**Step 1: Define the Topic, Key Concepts, and Education Level**

* Select a main topic for the quiz (e.g., ecosystems, species interactions, conservation).  
* Identify 3 to 5 key concepts to assess in the quiz (e.g., human impact, biotic and abiotic interactions).  
* Indicate if the quiz is for undergraduate (bachelor’s) or graduate (master’s or PhD) students.  
* Would you like to adapt this quiz for any students with special needs (e.g., dyslexia, comprehension difficulties)?

**Step 2: Create Closed Questions (Multiple Choice or True/False)** ChatGPT will generate closed questions with varying levels of complexity based on the students' education level and needs. You can validate or modify these questions as necessary.

**Step 3: Create Open-Ended Questions** ChatGPT will generate open-ended questions, again with varying levels of complexity. Teachers can validate or modify the questions, including offering adaptations for special needs students.

**Step 4: Adaptation for Special Needs Students** Do you need to make adjustments for students with special needs? ChatGPT can simplify vocabulary, break down complex questions into smaller parts, and add visual aids if necessary.

**Step 5: Multilingual Option** In which language(s) would you like to create this quiz? Would you like a bilingual version for international students?

#### Activity 3C: Generating Questions from a Text Corpus with Difficulty Levels, Language Choice, and Feedback

The prompt you provided employs **conversational prompting**, **structured prompting**, and **adaptive prompting**. Here's a breakdown of the techniques used:

**Key Techniques Used:**

7. **Conversational Prompting**:  
   * The prompt engages the user in a dialogue, asking for input step by step. This interactive approach ensures that the user is involved in each part of the process and can guide the generation of the quiz based on their needs.  
8. **Structured Prompting**:  
   * The workflow is clearly broken into well-defined steps (Step 1: Provide the text corpus, Step 2: Choose language, etc.), allowing the AI to guide the user systematically through the quiz creation process. Each step builds on the previous one to ensure a comprehensive and organized process.  
9. **Adaptive Prompting**:  
   * The user is given the option to adapt the quiz based on their preferences (e.g., choosing the language, difficulty level, and whether or not to receive hints). This flexibility makes the prompt more responsive to individual learning needs and goals, tailoring the experience to each user.  
10. **Feedback-Driven Prompting**:  
    * The prompt emphasizes the importance of feedback, offering both **quantitative** (scores for closed and open-ended questions) and **qualitative** (detailed suggestions and explanations) feedback. This helps the user not only to assess their performance but also to learn from the process and improve their understanding.  
11. **Difficulty Level Customization**:  
    * The prompt allows the user to select the level of difficulty (easy, medium, advanced), ensuring that the questions generated are appropriate for the user's current level of understanding. This helps in targeting the quiz at the right level of complexity.  
12. **Iterative Feedback Process**:  
    * After each set of questions (closed and open-ended), the user receives immediate feedback, allowing for continuous learning and improvement throughout the process. This step-by-step feedback mechanism enhances the learning experience by offering guidance after each question.

### **Summary:**

This prompt leverages **conversational prompting** to engage the user, **structured prompting** to guide them through a step-by-step process, and **adaptive prompting** to customize the experience based on language, difficulty, and feedback preferences. The use of **feedback-driven prompting** ensures that the user receives meaningful, actionable insights after answering both closed and open-ended questions, enhancing their learning and understanding.

**Objective:** This prompt allows students to generate closed and open-ended questions from a text corpus they provide. They can choose the difficulty level of the questions, request hints before answering, and receive feedback in a language of their choice. They can also opt to receive additional information to review or deepen their understanding of the topic.

**Ready to generate your own quiz based on a text corpus?** Provide a text (e.g., an academic article, textbook chapter, or report), and ChatGPT will generate both closed (multiple-choice, true/false) and open-ended questions from the text. You’ll receive feedback to help you improve your answers.



**Step 1: Provide the Text Corpus**

* Upload or paste a text you’d like to base your quiz on. This can be an academic article, a textbook section, or any relevant material.

**Step 2: Language Choice**

* In which language would you like to answer the quiz or receive the explanations and feedback? You can choose to respond in your preferred language or receive feedback in another language.

**Step 3: Choose the Difficulty Level**

* Indicate the difficulty level of the questions you want to generate:  
  * **Easy** (basic understanding),  
  * **Medium** (intermediate analysis),  
  * **Advanced** (deep comprehension and critical thinking).

**Step 4: Generate Closed Questions**

* Based on the text and the difficulty level you selected, ChatGPT will create multiple-choice and true/false questions.  
* **Do you want to receive hints for these questions before answering?**  
* After answering, you’ll receive immediate feedback with explanations for each question.

**Step 5: Generate Open-Ended Questions**

* ChatGPT will generate open-ended questions according to the difficulty level chosen.  
* **Would you like to receive hints before answering these questions?**  
* After submitting your responses, you’ll receive both quantitative and qualitative feedback.

**Step 6: Feedback**

* For both closed and open-ended questions, you will receive:  
  * **Quantitative Feedback:** A score breakdown for each question.  
  * **Qualitative Feedback:** Detailed suggestions on how to improve your responses and gain a deeper understanding of the material.

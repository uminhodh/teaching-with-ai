### Prompt engineering in Active Learning and AI integration

Prompt Engineering is an essential skill when integrating AI into education. Understanding how to craft effective prompts can significantly enhance learning outcomes by guiding AI responses toward specific pedagogical goals. There are various techniques for designing prompts, each serving different educational purposes.

#### Conversational vs. Structured Prompting

##### **Conversational prompting**:

* This approach is flexible and open-ended, allowing for dynamic and spontaneous interactions between the AI and the user. Conversational prompting is ideal when students need to explore ideas, ask questions, or delve deeper into topics through discussion. This type of prompting encourages creativity and critical thinking, offering students the freedom to shape the direction of their learning based on their curiosity and ongoing interactions with AI.  
  * **Example**: A student asks, "How did urbanization impact migration patterns in the 20th century?" The AI responds, and the student can follow up with questions like, "Can you give me examples of specific cities?" leading to a dialogue that evolves based on the student's interest.

  ##### **Structured prompting**:

  * In structured prompting, the AI is provided with a predefined set of questions or steps, ensuring that the output is clear, focused, and goal-oriented. This type of prompting is ideal for tasks where students must follow specific steps to achieve an outcome, such as writing essays, solving problems, or conducting research. It promotes logical progression and helps scaffold student thinking.  
  * **Example**: A prompt like, "Explain how urbanization affects social services, starting with infrastructure, then discussing housing and public health," guides the AI to generate responses in a clear, step-by-step manner.  
    **Example**:  
    *Prompt*: "*Analyze how the theme of power is portrayed in George Orwell’s "1984." Start by examining the role of the Party and its control over individuals. Then, discuss the impact of surveillance on personal freedom, providing examples from specific scenes in the novel. Finally, evaluate how Orwell’s critique of power dynamics relates to modern-day concerns about privacy.*"  
    This prompt doesn’t simply ask for an answer; they **guide** the student through a **structured process** that encourages thoughtful analysis, critical thinking, and application of concepts. That’s what makes them structured prompts.  
1. **Clear and defined task**:  
   * **Each example begins with a specific task** (e.g., "*Analyze how the theme of power is portrayed in George Orwell’s 1984*"), guiding the student step by step through the expected process.  
2. **Step-by-step breakdown**:  
   * **The task is broken down into clear, logical steps**, such as "*Start by examining..." followed by "Then, discuss...*" and "*Finally, evaluate...*" These steps scaffold the student's thinking, helping them progress in a structured manner.  
3. **Guidance on focus areas**:  
   * **The prompt include specific focus area** (e.g., *"surveillance on personal freedom"*) that keep the student's work targeted and relevant to the learning objectives.  
4. **Encouragement of critical thinking**:  
   * **Each prompt pushes students to go beyond basic recall** by analyzing, comparing, evaluating, and proposing solutions, **aligning with higher-order thinking skills in Bloom’s Taxonomy.**  
5. **Scaffolded learning objectives**:  
   * The prompt is designed to build on prior knowledge and push students toward a deeper understanding by asking them to apply, analyze, and evaluate information.  
     **Benefits**: Structured prompting ensures that students follow a clear and logical path in their learning, promoting critical thinking and deeper understanding as they build knowledge step by step.

     #### Key techniques to guide AI responses in the classroom

     Here’s an explanation of each prompting technique, applied to an example of urbanization, showing how they work in practice:  
1. **Zero-Shot Prompting**:  
   1. **Example**: *"What are the effects of urbanization on society?*"  
   2. **Explanation**: This technique offers no prior examples or steps. It is useful for broad, open-ended queries but may result in less detailed or focused responses.  
2. **Few-Shot Prompting**:  
   1. **Example**: *"Urbanization can lead to increased economic growth but also causes housing shortages. Now, explain the effects of urbanization on society, including both positive and negative aspects*."  
   2. **Explanation**: This technique provides examples to guide AI responses. By giving specific cues, students can expect more structured and nuanced responses.  
3. **Chain-of-Thought Prompting**:  
   1. **Example**: *"First, explain what urbanization is. Then, discuss how it affects economic growth. Finally, explain its impact on housing and infrastructure.*"  
   2. **Explanation**: This technique breaks the task into multiple logical steps, encouraging the AI to gradually deepen its response. It helps students engage in more detailed thinking.  
4. **Generated Knowledge Prompting**:  
   1. **Example**: *"Urbanization has historically led to industrial growth in cities. Now, explain how this shift affects social structures, such as migration patterns and job opportunities.*"  
   2. **Explanation**: The AI is given prior knowledge to build upon, leading to more detailed and accurate responses based on enriched information.  
5. **Least-to-Most Prompting**:  
   1. **Example**: *"Start by explaining what urbanization is. Then, describe its effects on infrastructure and social services. Finally, analyze how urbanization leads to economic disparity in cities*."  
   2. **Explanation**: This technique progresses from simple to complex ideas, helping students grasp foundational concepts before tackling more challenging elements.  
6. **Self-Refine Prompting**:  
   1. **Example**: *"Explain the effects of urbanization on society. Now, revise your explanation to include the environmental impact and potential solutions to overcrowding in cities*."  
   2. **Explanation**: Here, the AI is asked to improve or revise its initial response. This encourages students to critically evaluate and refine their work.  
7. **Maieutic Prompting**:  
   1. **Example**: "*What is urbanization? Now, explain how urbanization impacts migration patterns. Finally, analyze the arguments for and against urbanization from both economic and environmental perspectives."*  
   2. **Explanation**: This technique deepens understanding by asking progressively more reflective questions, encouraging students to revisit and expand their answers.

      #### Steps to Create a Structured Prompt

1. **Define the Challenge**: Clearly state the problem or task and the desired outcome.  
   * *Example*: *"Analyze the impact of the Industrial Revolution on social class structures in Europe.*"  
2. **Break Down the Logic**: Organize the prompt into sequential steps that guide students through the thinking process.  
   * *Example*: *"First, define the Industrial Revolution. Then, identify the major changes in social class. Finally, evaluate how these changes influenced political dynamics in Europe.*"  
3. **Test Iteratively**: Experiment with different cases or student groups to ensure the prompt works as intended.  
   * *Example*: Run the prompt with students, observe their responses, and adjust as needed for clarity and depth.  
4. **Adjust Based on Feedback**: Refine the prompt using feedback from students or peers, ensuring it is suitable for the learning objectives and student needs.  
   * *Example*: Simplify a step if it proves too difficult or unclear for students.  
5. **Collaborate**: Share the structured prompt with colleagues for feedback and improvement.  
   * *Example*: A colleague teaching the same subject could help ensure the prompt is aligned with course goals.
